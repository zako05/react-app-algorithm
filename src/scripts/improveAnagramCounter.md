## Code Description: `improveAnagramCounter`

This JavaScript function, `improveAnagramCounter`, efficiently counts the number of anagrams of each query word present in a given dictionary.

**Functionality Breakdown:**

1.  **Anagram Mapping (Dictionary Processing):**
    * The function initializes a `Map` called `anagramMap` to store sorted words (representing anagram groups) as keys and their corresponding counts as values.
    * It iterates through each `word` in the `dictionary` array.
    * For each `word`, it:
        * Splits the `word` into an array of characters.
        * Sorts the character array alphabetically.
        * Joins the sorted character array back into a string (`sortedWord`).
        * Updates the `anagramMap`:
            * If `sortedWord` already exists as a key, it increments its value (count) by 1.
            * If `sortedWord` doesn't exist, it adds it as a key with a value of 1.
    * This step effectively groups all anagrams in the dictionary by their sorted representation and counts their occurrences.

2.  **Query Processing:**
    * The function initializes an empty array called `matchingWords` to store the counts of matching anagrams for each query word.
    * It iterates through each `word` in the `query` array.
    * For each `word`, it:
        * Splits the `word` into an array of characters.
        * Sorts the character array alphabetically.
        * Joins the sorted character array back into a string (`sortedWord`).
        * Retrieves the count of `sortedWord` from the `anagramMap` using `anagramMap.get(sortedWord)`.
        * If `sortedWord` exists in the `anagramMap`, it pushes its count to the `matchingWords` array.
        * If `sortedWord` does not exist, it pushes 0 to the `matchingWords` array.
    * This step looks up the sorted version of each query word in the pre-built anagram map, and returns the number of times that anagram appeared in the dictionary.

3.  **Return Result:**
    * The function returns the `matchingWords` array, which contains the counts of anagrams for each query word.

**Example Usage:**

```javascript
const dictionary = ["listen", "silent", "hello", "world", "act", "cat"];
const query = ["silent", "dog", "tac"];
const result = improveAnagramCounter(dictionary, query);
console.log(result); // Output: [2, 0, 2]
